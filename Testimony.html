                <h3>Surabhi Hiwale, Psychiatrist</h3>
                <p>I have been learning with Ranjitha for just under a year. What is most unique about learning with her is the trust she places in my creative ability and the freedom to explore it. There is no doubt about her commitment to the art which
                    is truly inspiring, but she also comes with incredible humility that makes her approachable. I would recommend her to anyone interested in classical music at any stage of their learning.</p>

                <h3>Rohan Kumar, Student</h3>
                <p>Ranjitha Akka is an exceptional Hindustani classical music teacher whose profound knowledge of this art form has been truly inspiring. Her teaching style is patient and methodical, ensuring that each concept is clearly understood and beautifully
                    internalised. Ranjitha Akka balances tradition and modernity, encouraging me to grasp the depth of Hindustani music while exploring its nuances. As someone also learning Carnatic classical music, I particularly value her insights into
                    how both styles complement and differ from each other. Her ability to explain the uniqueness of each raag and its emotional essence has significantly deepened my appreciation for Indian classical music. Under her guidance, my musical
                    journey has flourished, and I am immensely grateful for her dedication and expertise.
                </p>

                <h3>Shrita Sira, Student</h3>
                <p>Learning from Ranjitha aunty at Naadasonic has truly helped me gain a solid foundation in Hindustani music. She is so patient in her approach to teaching music and ensures you are clear about how to sing something. I have seen a huge improvement
                    in my voice. She delves deeper into all the Raags, something I loved learning about.</p>

                <h3>Bhakti Pande, Student</h3>
                    <p>Choosing the right teacher was vital to my improvement in Hindustani classical music. Ranjitha Ji is helpful, kind and most importantly, very patient. She has an encouraging attitude and always finds ways to make 
                        class fun. Her passion for classical music is contagious. With her guidance, I have been able to understand the nuances and emotions of various raags. I look forward to our lessons each week!</p>
    
                    <h3>Prarthana Sharma, Student</h3>
                    <p>Learning Hindustani Music from my guru, Ranjitha, is wonderfully rewarding and refreshing. The way my guru delivers her lessons is almost in a poetic form, in which she incorporates explanations of each Raag, mood of the raag, placement 
                        of swaras, and all the technicalities combined. She teaches me techniques to strengthen my voice, develop different ways of singing and never fails to encourage me in exploring my own voice. Every lesson is melodious, calming, enriching and 
                        informative, with challenges, new lessons and exercises. I feel incredibly lucky and privileged to be under the guidance and teaching of Ranjitha, who always uplifts me as an individual and has given me great exposure to the beautiful world of Hindustani Music.</p>
